# JWE (JSON Web Encryption)

In part 3, I implemented a Signed JWS token. In this part, I'm implementing an encrypted JWE token.
Actually, I'm just going to use a library, I'm not going to implement it myself.

## Libraries

In my last post, I used github.com/golang-jwt/jwt to sign sign data as well and validate the token I had generated with my own code.

It was interesting to see that this library does *not* support encryption.
Instead, it has a companion libary at github.com/golang-jwt/jwe. This library doesn't seem
to be as popular. It has only 5 commits, from two contributors, and the last commit was 2 years ago.

Let's take a look at some others.

According to jwt.io, these are the most popular go jwt libraries, sorted by stars.

I noticed just now that jwt.io tells us if the library supports signing, but doesn't tell us if it supports encryption.

Maybe JWE is a little more esoteric than I had originally assumed.

Then, just quickly glancing at a few of them and make comment about their status and whether they support encryption

| github.com/nickvellios/gojwt    | 12     |
| github.com/gilbsgilbs/jwit      | 5      |
 

So and after this quick glance, I'm going to continue on using letsrrat-go/jwx.
It supports both Compact and JSON serialization, which many others do not. It supports encryption, where some others do not, and now that
I've read the RFCs and understand more about it, I appreciate that it doesn't mearly target the JWT case, but the entire JOSE family.

It also seems (although I do not yet know) to support some of the kind of advacned features in the JOSE tech stack, so maybe it can
handle some of thsoe StringOrURI keys, jwk sets, and things like thta. Hmm. I guess I'll find out.

## JWK

To encrypt, I need to make a key, and in the JOSE world, we are talking about JWK (json web key) objects.

I know I'll see this later on, oauth uses JWK to distribute public keys as keysets.
For example, the oauth certs in the google serts endpoint looks like this:

https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs
```
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "e": "AQAB",
      "n": "wf1QrSd3mb3vX2ntibkz-lyQ67UeNJ_q44U-VzJIv9ysj2fM_tOplcS3zPG1nQ0_o85LmP_ivM6svoUwZ4PPizDaE6-Ahk6Cngv9FtN98GbsFDuou3aLNuwA6cvR_TCMXyfAO69oDjph9wviHH0WSyV-jqXjvzt8fVOiARhYN5BsH25YgnGRKW3r5RUxLYEamDWQ8UMCy8x1OPrY6LioKR5lXchjUAGLjx-dBUw6sj6fA8LJKt4XaQ62bGQrs93jlIKir_hRUPeEhrNSFLCr3W0yVjlCh5a9dIcgSkaa5oIJYQTFQq6jHznrsKC4i4POa601TcjMsjBc_6n5Qof8iQ",
      "kid": "e863fe292fa2a2967cd7551c42a1211bcac55071",
      "alg": "RS256",
      "kty": "RSA",
      "use": "sig"
    },
    {
      "e": "AQAB",
      "kid": "1dc0f172e8d6ef382d6d3a231f6c197dd68ce5ef",
      "n": "3zWQqZ_EHrbvwfuq3H7TCBDeanfgxcPxno8GuNQwo5vZQG6hVPqB_NfKNejm2PQG6icoueswY1x-TXdYhn7zuVRrbdiz1Cn2AsUFHhD-FyUipbeXxJPe7dTSQaYwPyzQKNWU_Uj359lXdqXQ_iT-M_QknGTXsf4181r1FTaRMb-89Koj2ZHSHZx-uaPKNzrS92XHoxFXqlMMZYivqEAUE_kAJp-jQ5I5AAQf318zVGPVJX7BxkbcPaM46SZNJaD0ya7uhKWwluqgSjHkOObI5bbq9LmV3N51jzPgxGrH2OEeQBCXzggYzjMVlNuUnfQbNKvF3Xqc4HHWXulDsszGRQ",
      "alg": "RS256",
      "use": "sig",
      "kty": "RSA"
    }
  ]
}
```

So from looking at this, it's obvious that these are not simply RSA PEM formatted files. It's a JSON object, with properties of the key
exposed as properties of the object.

Let's make a similar key.

I'm not sure how to generate JWKs directly, but I notice there is an `Import` method I can sue to import a key from the standard crypto library.


```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/v3/jwk"
	"crypto/rand"
	"crypto/rsa"
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	rsapriv, err := rsa.GenerateKey(rand.Reader, 2048)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	jwkpriv, err := jwk.Import(rsapriv)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	jwkpub, err := jwkpriv.PublicKey()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	marshaled, err := json.Marshal(jwkpub)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Println(string(marshaled))
}

```

This looks a whole lot like the google certs endpoint, though it's missing a few of the fields I see there, but it correctly
identifies the "kty" (key type)

```
$ go run main.go  | jq
{
  "e": "AQAB",
  "kty": "RSA",
  "n": "sWqo-0ricLj5Z8JIktcU5ZwY0zwn8WSUDb5UP2JGHkXOL3VSLbn81FU1RGNEeC7s7LTjfks6HV4CX_1GyrJTrM3uxNa0Q0qk8A03rX1SUneaPssxiJTRo1jvvmAUuWYFxP4P_AfFKlCFRoDmspeKjOYn9Rm89eoLef66oihgUmTYNwVWYpeDvJ-_1tpnaOVlH5vm5W6LYbwkMEzYBnYx9el7vfBwXxaR0Zkav8DxcnZhBbv-QO4GT-gIxsjfj7e7_Usz8GQy-tbIUO86p2YKyy8Cka1E4mUxqqhv1-E7aAr2f26_HJJ4C8dZTYwb24w4VsKbE0f7OLSbo8EA2jPmuw"
}
```

The library also allows us to parse keys that are already in JWK format, so we can use it this way as well.

I'm going to use this private key for the rest of the examples, so if you are reading this, you can follow along.

```go
func main() {
	privbytes := []byte(`{"d":"gmNPxKWZ5P93FRK9As7q2xc0ikby7CPoNOgte-cbhrPsV0pmSrCUNt3K2uSSvrwK-16s_g4r5Sn0u2npK2wMDCUWpjUanrkkXrK_Jy6Lu3yVbqtRDNScs1rUDLpsHbhW1MYbQvVlALyzrvKd_PSG2z6VUoz8S7EORIISgTdKtDf9XNF7jtxDpcjv7e_YeNF86w5ChUbdCN-VXnfSyAo6jBUaEeMXK2RKB6mqEGePKdbxF_0PkbdcJpj3ChdmkG2w2o-LaxO3QMMbN2lOCUUePpBgKe_0Ktjd097FUHfySouWFMzJMFRY-24eKfG1N2O0iCUISeFdyPh1ykMV99ffgQ","dp":"lTkyAKm97OdJ20xMl61wCBtUptHcTTDvw35sGQonSUvowA68fHxS4EB3ZUvtvCE-3Ac3h49ThJ8DeXJIkcze3YjCHWS29EeNJ6hqosRy8s1H2vUgJQpDZd8GRCzgHCoBk73fdtIc1SW-8-9EMmEqrLb5ThqBz2d_K30dPFwx4wE","dq":"notRxo75EUtv97JeTUbFJn26dbtqpBr9X3D5PNbLozVycepYGAWF4CtGl46_9OEnJFyDW1UOGa6h3GlpNEAqdZW2DY9c6yeZhuF_pVYVTnbpXprVZBevYGAwhScbnM5feCN3InWDX2wBMLlD0ALDvCAVbmwau4kAH_7NYe6ns6E","e":"AQAB","kty":"RSA","n":"y5HGdzxMyOU73F760c2Gr-hiUW_yW6eMYDznHLjIjoIZ6gZ2QhCqtT_xH6d7qBmTYXiy_EsGPzqpXajnVuG0g1JOHlUzwfB97CZb8RS_MMvxKehr0uFzCYqZR2k_kPv44jbTkO_LvGnsM65h4Ssx8JqQ2R-aFa6-B24dshuTyKw2tNDEDxfnerpZLqgeQZxpo2hdUwXYYK9GYAEP5CPfOOTklhFYeweOkzZRc7Vs-Xm8i7daGRIr1wL3OEG33muL-aCyn9Z9loZGw-ANXYOrHIFxDmnas7T9ZC7n4dR_rpbGjA86cPkKZ2dDhPesmDIAX830h1Yr6pbUI_9DJEo2VQ","p":"7yJ_wuC-CdkU2UcpFsxeFOdXWZSm2tMcXzzK3RWixqFda7cQfvQTzz6lS1angxk1RCT64mWHIsUonchTWxOI4P_MKE4_2yIP64C3J_TrHNi0iJg1C-I0yIdJiO8ADnxhVogh-4C5VcAGkh3_aMwZuhngyG_fz8hnevgKxqtbVnU","q":"2e0n2u9OFhd96M6C_y8ryv0kr2QUSwycCw0_4ziWx24dqsBeguZnfu39g12cLw_dwJvg1gqmR1F0TEhB1fdZPaUpR7l7o-jZ-6VLfZnm6DiGxqx4gF-iUVz2ZBHk-IVEGc9BDwVwKb90S9ksKzm5LHuxtV11NAVpDfWqjs-uJGE","qi":"EXrd4PP8LFLsmkBJodwUCAQKMSVILwY9rkC1kSeolsSTldRlwaQWpz8j4OFrvIG04CsTyf34sSLZaUp-jAIS9x_i7HBZ3Ei1SYoXBjzN8EwUmkZ0nh5z_1tEwbhkHVsH7kuziwskSKaMOvyo5iOfbSapfcsAe8X7J6skhSeMiq0"}`)

## Encrypting data with a JWK

Using the JWK.

Or, actually... not even using the JWK. Standard crypto keys also work.

But using the JWK - *or* - another crypto key, we can encrypt data 

Note that this is not encrypting a JWT token with claims, it's simply creating a JWE object with some generic data as the payload.

I like this, it's conformant to the spec. Although I must admit that before I had read the RFCs, the reason for this would be very unclear.

Check it out, we can use the key we created earlier to encrypt some data and the output is something that looks like a JWT token, but
is in fact just a JWE object with some bytes as the payload.

```go
	enc, err := jwe.Encrypt([]byte("any bytes"), jwe.WithKey(jwa.RSA_OAEP(), privKey))
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Println(string(enc))
```

produces

```

```


If we take a look at the header, it tells us what we need to know to decrypt the header, but it doesn't have a cty or typ indicated, which seems right to me, considering this is filled with arbitrary data.

```
$ basenc --base64url -d <<<eyJhbGciOiJSU0EtT0FFUCIsImVuYyI6IkEyNTZHQ00ifQ
{"alg":"RSA-OAEP","enc":"A256GCM"}
```

To satisfy my curiosity, I tried adding some things to the key that I know to be part of the JWK spec, and some things that are not part of it to see what would happen. Let's see if I can set the Key ID and have it reflected in the JWE object header.

```go

	privKey.Set("kid", "123")  // a real part of a JWK
	privKey.Set("hi", "there") // not part of a JWK.
```

Although it doesn't throw any kind of error when setting the bogus "hi" key, it doesn't show up in the output when we look at the key,
whereas the "kid" does.

```
$ go run main.go  | cut -d'.' -f1 | basenc --base64url -d
{"alg":"RSA-OAEP","enc":"A256GCM","kid":"123"}
```


Okay, but moving back to the JWT token use case, how do we do that?


On this library, we do that with the serializer. There is comment [here](https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/blob/develop/v3/jwt/serialize.go#L43) that explains it.

```
// Serializer is a generic serializer for JWTs. Whereas other convenience
// functions can only do one thing (such as generate a JWS signed JWT),
// Using this construct you can serialize the token however you want.
//
// By default, the serializer only marshals the token into a JSON payload.
// You must set up the rest of the steps that should be taken by the
// serializer.
//
// For example, to marshal the token into JSON, then apply JWS and JWE
// in that order, you would do:
//
//	serialized, err := jwt.NewSerializer().
//	   Sign(jwa.RS256, key).
//	   Encrypt(jwa.RSA_OAEP, key.PublicKey).
//	   Serialize(token)
//
// The `jwt.Sign()` function is equivalent to
//
//	serialized, err := jwt.NewSerializer().
//	   Sign(...args...).
//	   Serialize(token)
```

I think this comment might be slightly wrong. Maybe it's just out of date. It requres an EncryptionOption, so we can use the WithKey option like before. 

It makes sense that we would do it this way. Sign so they can tell it acme from you, and and then encrypt with the publickey of the recipient.

Or at least, I must assume that is what they meant by this comment. Makes no sense to sign with your private key and encrypt with your own
public key.

We can also encrypt using our private key. I suppose this would also be a type of signature, just not a cleartext one.

Notice that this time, we have the "typ" header set automatically.

```
	serializer := jwt.NewSerializer().Encrypt(jwt.WithEncryptOption(jwe.WithKey(jwa.RSA_OAEP(), privKey)))
	enctok, err := serializer.Serialize(tok)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Println(string(enctok))
```

```
 go run main.go  | cut -d'.' -f1  | basenc -d --base64url
{"alg":"RSA-OAEP","enc":"A256GCM","kid":"123","typ":"JWT"}
```

## Decrypting the data

Something still feels a little off about the way this library.

If *only* signing is used, then we have a simple API that parses and verifies the token all in one run. You just pass an option to the Parse command to tell it you want it to verify a signing key. I expected to find similar encryption options for the Parse command, but there
is no such luck. Once again, it seems like JWE is bolted on as an aftertought.

When encryption is used, we have to do it in two steps. First decrypt the JWE container, then parse the signed JWT token.

Let's see all the steps. We create a token builder, assign some claims, and create a token. We create a serializer, tell it what keys to use for signing and encryption and use that to serialize the token.

Going in reverse, we have no such "de-serializer" interface that automatically unwraps. We just do it ourselves.
I think this is kind of unfortunate, since the spec allows us to specify the content type in the header, so I think we should be able
to detect what the next layer should be by looking at the `cty` header during parse. Instead, I see that, at least with this library,
the serializer does not use this header. missed opportunity, I think. Maybe I'll submit a PR for that later if it turns out to be as useful
as I think it might be in my mind. For that matter, you could have a key system where you lookup the `kid` in some key store, and use the appropriate key based only on what you see in the JOSE header. Look at header, parse appropriately, unwrap, repeat.

Anyway, here we are.

```go
	bldr := jwt.NewBuilder()
	bldr.Issuer("me")
	bldr.Subject("your mom")
	bldr.Claim("is", "so fat")
	tok, err := bldr.Build()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	pubKey, _ := privKey.PublicKey()
	serializer := jwt.NewSerializer()
	// sign with private key
	serializer.Sign(jwt.WithKey(jwa.RS256(), privKey))
	// encrypt (to ourselves) with our own public key
	serializer.Encrypt(jwt.WithEncryptOption(jwe.WithKey(jwa.RSA_OAEP(), pubKey)))
	enctok, err := serializer.Serialize(tok)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// parsing

	// decrypt the JWE
	ptTok2, err := jwe.Decrypt(enctok, jwe.WithKey(jwa.RSA_OAEP(), privKey))
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// parse the JWT, including verifying the signature.
	tok2, err := jwt.Parse(ptTok2, jwt.WithKey(jwa.RS256(), privKey))
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Println(tok2.Issuer())
