I want to learn some machine learning, and I don't know anything about it.

I recall maybe some 15 years ago reading about some artificial intelligence technology and writing a little python. Specifically, the technology I was playing with
was genetic algorithms. At the time, I was still learning how to program and I would make implementations of things I read about in articles and books, and one of
the ideas that cought my interest was genetic algorithms.
I doubt that people are still using genetic algorithms in AI or ML, but truly, I don't know. I'm almost a blank slate on this topic.

I don't plan on using ML at any professional level in the future, it's really just for the fun of learning something that is new to me.

My current experience with with AI is pretty basic:
* Have written a few genetic algorithms using a framework I wrote myself in python.
* Have not used any AI or ML libraries ever. Not professionally or for fun.
* I've used Github Copilot and a few LLM services that have popped up in the last few years.
* A company I previously worked for used distributed computing to train a neural network in a way to maintain data privacy. I was not involved in the project, but I
was in some meetings about it so I got the gist but not the details of how this is done.
* I am generally familiar with neural netowrks at a conceptual level.
* I know how to install ollama and import a model, but I'd be lost if I had to train a model.


I have a general plan for how I want to tackle this. The plan is to dedicate an hour a day twice a week doing *something* related to machine learning and contribute to a blog post.

Warm up:

It's been 15 years. Let's try to remember what a genetic algorithm is. This time, I'll write it in go.
This part, I'll do before I do any research. I'll write a basic game of some sort and come up with some kind of scoring system, then I'll write a genetic algorithms that will play the game.


After this, I'll do some reading about genetic algorithms and and I'll write a blog post about it. Maybe there is a modern use case for this kind of AI that I am unaware of.

I anticipate it will have some of these topics:
* cellular atomata
* spontaneous evoloops
* Conway's game of life is probably going to come up

I read an article some time ago about spontaneous artifical atomata coming appearing out of a random field of noise.
I am not (at time of writing) doing any research yet *at all* so I don't recall the article, but I'll find that and will probably write an article on this as well just because it's interesting.


Neural Networks:

Next, I want to learn about neural networks. I'll write one blog post about general neural network concepts.

* What kinds are there?
* What kinds of problems are they good at solving?
* How are they constructed?
* What is a tensor?
* How are they trained?

I'll write a simple neural network framework and will do some code reading of existing neural network libraries.
I'll consider this a success if I can train a neural network using only frameworks I've written myself.

Finally, I'll write a blog post about real world tools. If I wasn't just playing around in code, what tools would I actually use to train a model?
Hopefully by this time, I will have read enough to know what I'm talking about.

* How are LLMs like Chat GPT trained?
* Are computer vision or image generators trained the same way?
* Train a LLM using a popular framework
* Package my model in a popular format
* Deploy my model using a popular technique.
