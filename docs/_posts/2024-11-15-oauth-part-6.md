# Authentication Server

Let's write some crappy code to simulate an authentication server.

To check my understanding, I'm going to write a very basic authenticaiton server and see if I can get it work with the
go golang.org/x/oauth2.


We know the auth server is going to be authenticating "resource owners" and "clients".
The specification leaves it up to the implementor to decide how the authentication is done, so for the sake of
simplicity, I'm going to use basic auth for both.

Clients are pre-registered with the authentication server, in my case it's just hard-coded.

```go
func main() {
	resourceOwners := gin.Accounts{
		"user1": "userpassword1",
	}
	clients := gin.Accounts{
		"client1": "clientpassword1",
	}

	r := gin.Default()
	r.GET("/authorization",
		gin.BasicAuth(resourceOwners),
		AuthorizationHandler)
	r.POST("/token",
		gin.BasicAuth(clients),
		TokenHandler)
	r.Run("0.0.0.0:8888")
}

// https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.1
func AuthorizationHandler(c *gin.Context) {
}

// https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.2
func TokenHandler(c *gin.Context) {
}
```


## Authorization handler

This handler is authenticated by the resource owner (by basic auth, in this case).
Once the user is authenticated, the handler picks apart the request query parameters and makes a decision
about whether to authorize the client to request an access token.

The auth code returned by this handler is intentionally low quality, and it's probably not actually compliant.
The spec tells us that the auth code should have a short expiration time, and I'm not implementing that that here
for the sake of simplicity. This isn't about the auth token, it's just about the flow.

After we've authorized the resource owner, we redirect the user's browser back to the client so it can pass the auth code.

```go
// https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.1
// https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.1
// https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.2.1
func AuthorizationHandler(c *gin.Context) {
	responseType := c.Query("response_type")
	if responseType != "code" {
		c.JSON(400, gin.H{
			"error":             "invalid_request",
			"error_description": "response_type must be code",
		})
		return
	}

	clientId := c.Query("client_id")
	if clientId != "client1" {
		c.JSON(400, gin.H{
			"error":             "unauthorized_client",
			"error_description": "only client1 is supported",
		})
		return
	}

	redirectUri := c.Query("redirect_uri")
	if redirectUri != "http://localhost:8889/callback" {
		c.JSON(400, gin.H{
			"error":             "invalid_request",
			"error_description": "Only one callback URL is supported",
		})
		return
	}

	scope := c.Query("scope")
	// a real implementaiton should test whether the client is authorized to request the scope.
	// and return an unauthorized error if not.

	state := c.Query("state")

	nextUri, err := url.Parse(redirectUri)
	if err != nil {
		c.JSON(400, gin.H{
			"error":             "invalid_request",
			"error_description": "redirect_uri must be a valid URL",
		})
		return
	}

	values := url.Values{}

	if state != "" {
		values.Set("state", state)
	}

	code := AuthCode(scope)
	values.Set("code", code)

	nextUri.RawQuery = values.Encode()
	c.Redirect(302, nextUri.String())
}
```


## Token Handler

The token handler is the endpoint used by the client (not the resource owner) to exchange the auth
code for an access token. This ensures that the access token is never exposed to the user, and the
user will only ever see the auth code that expires after 10 minutes.

That's why this endpoint is authenticated using the client's credentials. The client will log
into the auth server shortly after the auth code was issued and will exchange it for a longer lived
access token, and possibly a refresh token as well.

This endpoint will receive the auth code, and verify it and the rest of the request is valid and gives a json response that includes the access token.


```go
// https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.2
// https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.3
func TokenHandler(c *gin.Context) {
	grantType := c.Query("grant_type")
	if grantType != "authorization_code" {
		c.JSON(400, gin.H{
			"error":             "invalid_request",
			"error_description": "grant_type must be authorization_code",
		})
		return
	}

	code := c.Query("code")
	if code == "" {
		c.JSON(400, gin.H{
			"error":             "invalid_request",
			"error_description": "code is required",
		})
		return
	}

	if !ValidateAuthCode(code) {
		c.JSON(400, gin.H{
			"error":             "invalid_request",
			"error_description": "code is invalid",
		})
		return
	}

	redirectUri := c.Query("redirect_uri")
	if redirectUri != "http://localhost:8889/callback" {
		c.JSON(400, gin.H{
			"error":             "invalid_request",
			"error_description": "Only one callback URL is supported",
		})
		return
	}

	clientId := c.Query("client_id")
	if clientId != "client1" {
		c.JSON(400, gin.H{
			"error":             "unauthorized_client",
			"error_description": "only client1 is supported",
		})
		return
	}

	if clientId != c.MustGet(gin.AuthUserKey).(string) {
		c.JSON(400, gin.H{
			"error":             "unauthorized_client",
			"error_description": "client_id does not match authenticated client",
		})
		return
	}

	// https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-5.1
	response := map[string]string{
		"access_token":  AccessToken(),
		"token_type":    "Bearer",
		"expires_in":    "3600",
		"refresh_token": "",
		"scope":         "fullaccessrootlevelbigboss",
	}

	c.Header("Cache-Control", "no-store")
	c.Header("Pragma", "no-cache")
	c.JSON(200, response)
}
```


# try it with curl.

First we log in as the resource owner and get the auth code

```bash
curl -i -uuser1:userpassword1 'localhost:8888/authorization?response_type=code&client_id=client1&redirect_uri=http://localhost:8889/callback&state=12345'

HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Location: http://localhost:8889/callback?code=WOOHOO%211234&state=12345
Date: Sat, 16 Nov 2024 00:55:55 GMT
Content-Length: 88

<a href="http://localhost:8889/callback?code=WOOHOO%211234&amp;state=12345">Found</a>.
```

That's right, the auth code is `WOOHOO!1234`. It's a very secure code.
now, let's mock the client and exchange the auth code for an access token.
We log in as the client, and pass the auth code we saw earlier.

```bash
$ curl -i -X POST -uclient1:clientpassword1 'localhost:8888/token?grant_type=authorization_code&code=WOOHOO%211234&client_id=client1&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8889%2Fcallback'

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: no-store
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Pragma: no-cache
Date: Sat, 16 Nov 2024 01:22:15 GMT
Content-Length: 131

{"access_token":"ACCESS_GRANTED","expires_in":"3600","refresh_token":"","scope":"fullaccessrootlevelbigboss","token_type":"Bearer"}
```


And it seems to work! At least with curl and with my understanding of the spec.
In the next post, I'll write a basic "client" and "resource server" and see if I an put all the
pieces of the puzzle together.
