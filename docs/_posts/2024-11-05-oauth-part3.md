# JWS (JSON Web Signature)

Continuing on from part 2, I'm studying JWT tokens, and looking in particular at the JWS serialization.

JWS is one of the two serialization formats for JWT tokens, and it's defined by [RFC 7515][jwsrfc].

The JWS signature used as a container for JWT tokens, but the actual content of the jws payload is opaque, so in this code I'm
going to just temporarially wipe my brain from anything related to JWT tokens, and this is going to be just simply a JWS implementation.

## Internal Structure

I think we get a hint about how the JWS should be structed by looking at section of JSON serialization in section 7.2.
This section states there is a "general" and a flattened" json serialization, and focusing on the "general" case, since it is the most complex,
it looks like this:

```
  {
      "payload":"<payload contents>",
      "signatures":[
       {"protected":"<integrity-protected header 1 contents>",
        "header":<non-integrity-protected header 1 contents>,
        "signature":"<signature 1 contents>"},
       ...
       {"protected":"<integrity-protected header N contents>",
        "header":<non-integrity-protected header N contents>,
        "signature":"<signature N contents>"}]
     }
}
```

With the regard to the header, it's represented by two fields, "protected" and "header". The combination fo these two fields is considered the
JOSE header, with the difference between the two being that "protected" is integrity protected and "header is not.

As far as what goes into these fields, I belive there is only one key that is required, which is the "alg" key to specify the algorithm.
Aside from this, we are free to add whatever key-value pairs we want. The specification is pretty open about this.

So my initial stab at an implimentation is this:

```go
type JOSE struct {
	Protected map[string]interface{}
	Header    map[string]interface{}
}

type SignatureElement struct {
	*JOSE
	Signature []byte
}

type JWS struct {
	Payload    []byte
	Signatures []*SignatureElement
}
```


Now, I want to add a little bit of logic about how the JOSE header is used. The spec tells us that the header is a union of the protected and header fields. There should not be duplicates, but I think if I do see a duplicate key at this stage, I think I should prefer to use the value from the protected field.

```go

func (j *JOSE) Get(key string) interface{} {
	if val, ok := j.Protected[key]; ok {
		return val
	}
	if val, ok := j.Header[key]; ok {
		return val
	}
	return nil
}

func (j *JOSE) CombinedHeader() map[string]interface{} {
	header := make(map[string]interface{})
	for k, v := range j.Header {
		header[k] = v
	}
	for k, v := range j.Protected {
		header[k] = v
	}
	return header
}

```

Lets implement some for a couple of the well-known headers.

For most of these, they are optional headers, and I'm not going to bother to implement them, but a couple of them have some logic attached. Here we go.

```go

func (j *JOSE) Alg() (string, error) {
	if alg, ok := j.Get("alg").(string); ok {
		return alg, nil
	}
	return "", fmt.Errorf("alg not found. This Header Parameter MUST be present RFC 7515 Section 4.1.1")
}

func (j *JOSE) Jku() (string, error) {
	// not implemented, optinal
	return j.Get("jku").(string), nil
}

func (j *JOSE) Jwk() (string, error) {
	// not implemented, optinal
	return j.Get("jwk").(string), nil
}

func (j *JOSE) Kid() (string, error) {
	// not implemented, optinal
	return j.Get("jwk").(string), nil
}

func (j *JOSE) X5u() (string, error) {
	// not implemented, optinal
	return j.Get("x5u").(string), nil
}

func (j *JOSE) X5c() (string, error) {
	// not implemented, optinal
	return j.Get("x5c").(string), nil
}

func (j *JOSE) X5t() (string, error) {
	// not implemented, optinal
	return j.Get("x5t").(string), nil
}

func (j *JOSE) X5tS256() (string, error) {
	// not implemented, optinal
	return j.Get("x5t#S256").(string), nil
}

func (j *JOSE) Typ() (string, error) {
    // not implemented, optional
	return j.Get("typ").(string), nil
}

func (j *JOSE) Cty() (string, error) {
	// not implemented, optinal
	return j.Get("cty").(string), nil
}

// RFC 7515 4.1.11
func (j *JOSE) Crit() ([]string, error) {
	if _, ok := j.Header["crit"]; ok {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("crit found in unprotected header. This is not allowd; crit must be in the protected header")
	}
	crit, ok := j.Protected["crit"]
	if !ok {
		return nil, nil
	}
	crits, ok := crit.([]string)
	if !ok {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("crit must be a list of strings")
	}
	if len(crits) == 0 {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("crit must not be empty if it exists")
	}
	return crits, nil
}


## Creating the signature

The procedure is documented in section 5.1.

```
  To create a JWS, the following steps are performed.  The order of the
   steps is not significant in cases where there are no dependencies
   between the inputs and outputs of the steps.

   1.  Create the content to be used as the JWS Payload.

   2.  Compute the encoded payload value BASE64URL(JWS Payload).

   3.  Create the JSON object(s) containing the desired set of Header
       Parameters, which together comprise the JOSE Header (the JWS
       Protected Header and/or the JWS Unprotected Header).

   4.  Compute the encoded header value BASE64URL(UTF8(JWS Protected
       Header)).  If the JWS Protected Header is not present (which can
       only happen when using the JWS JSON Serialization and no
       "protected" member is present), let this value be the empty
       string.

   5.  Compute the JWS Signature in the manner defined for the
       particular algorithm being used over the JWS Signing Input
       ASCII(BASE64URL(UTF8(JWS Protected Header)) || '.' ||
       BASE64URL(JWS Payload)).  The "alg" (algorithm) Header Parameter
       MUST be present in the JOSE Header, with the algorithm value
       accurately representing the algorithm used to construct the JWS
       Signature.

   6.  Compute the encoded signature value BASE64URL(JWS Signature).

   7.  If the JWS JSON Serialization is being used, repeat this process
       (steps 3-6) for each digital signature or MAC operation being
       performed.

   8.  Create the desired serialized output.  The JWS Compact
       Serialization of this result is BASE64URL(UTF8(JWS Protected
       Header)) || '.' || BASE64URL(JWS Payload) || '.' || BASE64URL(JWS
       Signature).  The JWS JSON Serialization is described in
       Section 7.2.

       ```

and I want to implement produce an HS256 signature. What seems to happen here is that a signature
algorithm is selected. Each signature algorithm has differing requirements about what kind of key they need.

HS256 uses a secret key as part of the signature

There are two RFCs to look at for this, [RFC 7518][jwarfc] and [RFC 7517][jwkrfc]. Those are for
"json web algorithms" and "json web keys", respectively. Thse will be used in signing schemes that use
a public key cryptography. However, for HS256, we will use a symmetric key that is already known to both parties.

The security ramifications of this scheme is actually spelled out in the spec, and also they are pretty obvious.
Since both parties have knowledge of the same key, they are both capable of creating or verifying the signature.
In some cryptographic schemes, the signature is used both to verify a message is not tampered, and also the identity of the sender.
In general, this is not the case for HS256 except in a very specific case. If only two parties know the secret, and you know that
the message was not created by you, then by process of elemination, you can deduce that the message was created by the other
party who knows the secret. I just point this out because HS256 is very common in real world JWT tokens, but it's not always the case.
This is not something I had considered until this study, there are no inherent security posture when using JWT tokens, but rather
the security implications of the token follows the hash algorithm and the key management scheme.

Here's something odd I am thinking about, and I don't know the answer. I wonder if there are any bugs in applications involving switching
out signatures so that they are handled differently. Say, if you have one cryptosystem that uses pub/priv keypair, and another with a shared secret.
I bet there are applications out there that just verify that the signature is valid, but don't verify whether the security context is correct.

I'm only going to support HS256, but I'll go through a few of the motions as though I might support other algorithms.
I think what ought to happen is that we will look at the JOSE header and pull out the "alg" header.
I'll consult a map of signing functions, if the signing function is found, I'll call it.

Since the required parameters may be different for each algorithm, I'll simply pass the JOSE header to the signing function and let it pull
out whatever headers it needs. This will be keys, or whatever else.

```go
type SigningFunc func(j *JOSE, payload []byte) ([]byte, error)


var signingFuncs = map[string]SigningFunc{
	"HS256": hmac_sha256,
}
```


where the hmac_256 function is defined like this:
In this case, we don't need to use the any keys from the JOSE header since the key is already known to us.

```go

var HS256Key = []byte("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456")

func hmac_sha256(j *JOSE, payload []byte) ([]byte, error) {
	key := sha256.Sum256([]byte(HS256Password))
	hm := hmac.New(sha256.New, key[:])

	hm.Write(payload)
	return hm.Sum(nil), nil
}
```

## Generating Signature payload


Going back to the steps in the RFC, the payload for the signature is the encoded URL and the encoded header separated by a period.
This is of course the saem as the compact serialization of the JWS. But actually, it isn't. It's only the same if all the headers are in the protected field.


From what I can tell, I think I have two scenarios:

If using compact serialization, all the headers are smushed together into the protected field, and then the signature is generated.

If using general serialization, the headers are split into protected and unprotected fields and the signature is generated using only the protected field

If this is the case, it would mean the signature is different for for the two cases. This seems a bit odd, and I am wondering if I am just not reading it correctly.

In any case, here is a function that will serialize the protected field.

```go

func (j *JOSE) SerializeProtected() ([]byte, error) {
	marshalled, err := json.Marshal(j.Protected)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	encoded := make([]byte, base64.RawURLEncoding.EncodedLen(len(marshalled)))
	base64.RawURLEncoding.Encode(encoded, marshalled)
	return encoded, nil

}

```

And a function that will sign the payload with a given algorithm.

Remember that my JWS structure mimics the general format, so this will create a new signature and append it to the Signatures list.

So I can do SignWith("hs256"), it will create the new signature and append it to the list.

```go
func (j *JWS) SignWith(alg string) error {
	signingFunc, ok := signingFuncs[alg]
	if !ok {
		return fmt.Errorf("alg not supported")
	}
	sigElem := NewSignatureElement()
	sigElem.Protected["alg"] = alg
	encodedHeader, err := sigElem.SerializeProtected()
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	signaturePayload := []byte(strings.Join([]string{string(encodedHeader), string(j.Payload)}, "."))
	signature, err := signingFunc(sigElem.JOSE, signaturePayload)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	sigElem.Signature = signature
	j.Signatures = append(j.Signatures, sigElem)
	return nil
}
```


# Put it together


I think there are multiple ways to represet a token with multiple signatures.

One way is to just generate a bunch of tokens with the same payload and a different signature.

Another way is to nest tokens inside of each other.

I'm going to go with the first option, it's just simpler. Let's write a compact serialization function
that will output a list of strings.

```go
func (j *JWS) SerializeCompact() ([]string, error) {
	tokens := make([]string, len(j.Signatures))
	for i, sigElem := range j.Signatures {
		marshaledHeader, err := json.Marshal(sigElem.CombinedHeader())
		if err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}
		encodedHeader := make([]byte, base64.RawURLEncoding.EncodedLen(len(marshaledHeader)))
		base64.RawURLEncoding.Encode(encodedHeader, marshaledHeader)
		encodedPayload := j.Payload
		encodedSignature := sigElem.Signature
		tokens[i] = strings.Join([]string{string(encodedHeader), string(encodedPayload), string(encodedSignature)}, ".")
	}
	return tokens, nil
}
```


# It works!

I wrote a simple main function that creates a JWS token using my janky implementation and then uses a more robust JWT library to produce one wiht the same claims. It works!

```go
package main

import (
	"encoding/base64"
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"github.com/golang-jwt/jwt"
)

func main() {
	claims := make(map[string]interface{})
	claims["iss"] = "The Issuer"
	claims["sub"] = "The Subject"

	claimsPayload, err := json.Marshal(claims)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	jws := NewJWS(claimsPayload)
	jws.SignWith("HS256")
	tokens, err := jws.SerializeCompact()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	for _, token := range tokens {
		fmt.Println(token)
	}

	fmt.Println("password, encoded to base64")
	fmt.Println(base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(HS256Key[:]))

	realToken := jwt.NewWithClaims(jwt.SigningMethodHS256, jwt.MapClaims(claims))
	realString, err := realToken.SignedString(HS256Key[:])
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Println("Real token")
	fmt.Println(realString)
}
```

it produces the following output:

```

eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJUaGUgSXNzdWVyIiwic3ViIjoiVGhlIFN1YmplY3QifQ.mUGcgTzLJsJWpQsmAKxOBexlD83izDZH6hIdkvAQBl0
password, encoded to base64

```

The reason why the tokens are different is because the JWT library also includes the "typ" header, and my implementation does not.

If I paste either of these tokens into [jwt.io][jwtio], I can verify that the signature is valid for both, and the claims are the same for both.


# Conclusion about JWTs.

I have learned a lot about JWTs by going through this exercise. I could spend time implementing JWE or additional algorithms, but I think this is a good spot
to switch over to a more robust JWT library and now learn about how JWTs are used in oauth flows.

In the future, I'll just be using the golang-jwt module and leave my study code behind.
