# Client and Resource Server

In this post, I'm going to write a client and resource server and have them all work in concert.

It would not be enough, however to simply write a few pieces of software myself and have them work together. I think it would be a
good idea, also to swap out the authentication server with a *real* implementation. When we get to that point, I'm going to use
[auth0](https://auth0.com/). I've used them before and they are a good service.



# The Client

The client is going to be a simple web application that implements the authorization code flow. Basically, I'm going to write a web
application that will implement the redirect/callback url and participate in token exchange with the authorization server using a
real web browser as the user agent.

Ater that, I'll take a look at [Bearer Token Usage RFC][bearerrfc] to see how the client should use the access token to access
resources.

## Required Handlers

According to the [OAuth 2.0 RFC][oauthrfc], the client needs only to implement the redirection endpoint, which is usually
referred to as the callback URL. However, we need at least one other handler to get the process started with the user agent, so I think
a practical minimum client will have two handlers.

Since this is a do-nothing application, I'm going to put the non-standard hander at the root path.

The RootHandler will build the authorization url and redirect the user agent to the authorization server.

I am aware that oauth is frequently used for user user logins, accessing profile data, etc. However, I am removing that from my mind
for this exercise. This is not a login page, it is just a flow for getting an access token.


# Security Warning

I'm going to do some things for simplicity that I know is wrong and is not secure.
If you're reading this as a tutorial, don't.

If it wasn't obvious by the bogus tokens I'm issuing, I'm not supporting HTTPS, I'm not
doing CSRF protection, or any of a miriad of other things that are required to make this
production quality.


## Mistakes in the auth server

While writing this post, I have realized a couple of mistakes in the auth server, so I'm going to paste that here in full.

It's still issuing bogus tokens tokens at this point, I'll fix that in a later post, but there is at least one major mistake that
I need to fix straight away. If you take a look at [section 4.1.3][https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.3] it tells us
that the parameters should be passed as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` format in the body of the Post. The code I wrote in the last post
does not do that.

This is how your auth server should look in full:

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
	"net/url"
)

func AuthCode(scope string) string {
	return "WOOHOO!1234"
}

func ValidateAuthCode(code string) bool {
	return code == "WOOHOO!1234"
}

func AccessToken() string {
	return "ACCESS_GRANTED"
}

func main() {
	resourceOwners := gin.Accounts{
		"user1": "userpassword1",
	}
	clients := gin.Accounts{
		"client1": "clientpassword1",
	}

	r := gin.Default()
	r.GET("/authorization",
		gin.BasicAuth(resourceOwners),
		AuthorizationHandler)
	r.POST("/token",
		gin.BasicAuth(clients),
		TokenHandler)
	r.Run("0.0.0.0:8888")
}

*whew*! glad we got that out of the way. Let's take a look at our client.


## Client Code

The client, if you recall, is a third party application. In this case, it's a web application listening on 8889.
It's job is to redirect the user to the authorization server and obtain an "auth code" from the user, and then
exchange that auth code for an access token.


As we start off, there are no *resources* and there is no *resource server*. Not yet. So let's just go through the
motiions of obtaining an auth token and display what we've got.

The root handler will be displaying all the tokens we know about in memory.

```go
func main() {
	r := gin.Default()
	r.GET("/", RootHandler)
	r.GET("/start", StartHandler)
	r.GET("/callback", CallbackHandler)
	r.Run("0.0.0.0:8889")
}

var (
	// global configuration
	// urls that we have previously discovered or arraged with the auth server
	AUTHORIZATION_URL = "http://localhost:8888/authorization"
	TOKEN_URL         = "http://localhost:8888/token"
	CLIENT_ID         = "client1"
	CLIENT_SECRET     = "clientpassword1"

	KNOWN_TOKENS = make([]*oauth2.Token, 0)
)

func RootHandler(c *gin.Context) {
	c.JSON(200, gin.H{
		"known_tokens": KNOWN_TOKENS,
	})
}
```


The `StartHandler` is not part of the oauth spec, but in my application it's the first step in the process.
It will look to its configuration and redirect the user to the authorizations server with the correct parameters.

I'm using "favorite_animal" as some silly state that I want to pass through the whole process.

The url it constructs will look something like this

`http://<auth_server>/authorization?response_type=code&client_id=client1&redirect_uri=http://localhost:8889/callback&state=ABCDEFBASE64`

```go
func StartHandler(c *gin.Context) {
	redirectUri, _ := url.Parse(AUTHORIZATION_URL)
	values := url.Values{}
	values.Set("response_type", url.QueryEscape("code"))
	values.Set("client_id", url.QueryEscape(CLIENT_ID))
	values.Set("redirect_uri", url.QueryEscape("http://localhost:8889/callback"))
	favoriteAnimal := c.Query("favorite_animal")
	if favoriteAnimal != "" {
		favoriteAnimal = "undecided"
	}
	nextPage := c.Query("next")
	if nextPage == "" {
		nextPage = "/"
	}
	state, _ := json.Marshal(map[string]string{
		"favorite_animal": favoriteAnimal,
		"next":            nextPage,
	})
	values.Set("state", url.QueryEscape(string(state)))
	redirectUri.RawQuery = values.Encode()
	c.Redirect(302, redirectUri.String())
}
```


The auth server will do it's thing and then redirect the user back here, to the `CallbackHandler`. The auth server
will have loaded up the user agent with an access code, which we should extract and exchange it for the access token.

I'm trying to use the golang oauth2 package to do this part. The oauth2 package is standard compliant and it supports
multiple oauth flows. Since we are using the authorization code flow, we need to use the Exchange method to exchange
the access code for the access token.

This method constructs the oauth2 config object. The Exchange function will log into the auth server using basic auth,
pass and will return an oauth2 token struct.

What happens afterward is not part of the oauth spec, but in my application, I'm storing the oauth token so it can be
displayed on the root page, and then redirecting the user to the next page (which will be the root page).

The goofy favorite_animal state should still be there.


```go
func CallbackHandler(c *gin.Context) {
	code, err := url.QueryUnescape(c.Query("code"))
	if err != nil {
		c.String(500, "Failed to unescape code: %v", err)
		return
	}

	state, err := url.QueryUnescape(c.Query("state"))
	if err != nil {
		c.String(500, "Failed to unescape state: %v", err)
		return
	}

	config := oauth2.Config{
		ClientID:     CLIENT_ID,
		ClientSecret: CLIENT_SECRET,
		RedirectURL:  "http://localhost:8889/callback",
		Endpoint: oauth2.Endpoint{
			AuthURL:   AUTHORIZATION_URL,
			TokenURL:  TOKEN_URL,
			AuthStyle: oauth2.AuthStyleInHeader,
		},
	}

	tok, err := config.Exchange(c, code)
	if err != nil {
		c.String(500, "Failed to exchange token: %v", err)
		return
	}
	KNOWN_TOKENS = append(KNOWN_TOKENS, tok)

	var stateData map[string]string
	if err := json.Unmarshal([]byte(state), &stateData); err != nil {
		c.String(500, "Failed to unmarshal state: %v", err)
		return
	}

	nextPage := stateData["next"]
	nextUrl, err := url.Parse(nextPage)
	if err != nil {
		nextUrl, _ = url.Parse("/")
	}
	nextValues := url.Values{}
	nextValues.Set("favorite_animal", stateData["favorite_animal"])
	nextUrl.RawQuery = nextValues.Encode()
	c.Redirect(302, nextUrl.String())
```


## Client Login In Action

Imagine it. You're browsing the website, looking at the root page.
![First Root](/_images/oauth-firstroot.png)

Then, you follow a link that will kick off the oauth flow. In this case we went to
`http://localhost:8889/start?favorite_animal=chipmunk`

The image below shows us looking at the auth server, which is prompting us to log in using basic auth. And we do log in using user1:userpassword1
![Login](/_images/oauth-login.png)

We log in and we get snapped back to the client callback, which only takes a second to do the token exchange and then we are redirected again
back to the root page from whence we came, but now, the client has an access token
![Second Root](/_images/oauth-secondroot.png)


I'll re-iterate again that especially for auth flow, you should not be displaying the access token. It's a secret that only the client should know, but we now have
a client and auth server that are working correctly together.


# The resource server

The final component is the resource server. RFC 6749 has little to say about it. We can see in [Section 7][https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-7] that it only
specifies that the resource token should validate the access token, but tells us that

```
"The method in which the client utilizes the access token to authenticate with the resource server depends on the type of access token issued by the authorization server. "
```

I'd say that's pretty undefined. We have an access token, but what exactly is it?

Furthermore, I happen to know there can be different access policies for different resources. Even in the golang oauth2 package, we can see that the access token granted might be
"online" or "offline", to indicate a policy where the client might only access resources while the end user is still online (and therefore have short expirations) or if a refresh token
should be granted, allowing the client to continue to request new access tokens without the user's intervention. This behavior is likewise undefined in this RFC.

In this case, I'm going to write a *very simple* resource server with almost no security whatsoever.

It will accept the kind of access token issued by my auth server, a string that says "ACCESS_GRANTED". As long as it sees that, it will return the resources.

In a future post, I'll add some security hardening, including using a reasonable auth token. For now, this is my resource server.

For now, let's go ahead and write the resource server.

While it is not required, the access token is frequently passed as a Bearer token in the Authorization header. The [Bearer Token Usage RFC][bearerrfc] specifies several different methods
that might be used to transmit the accss token, including HTTP headers, query parameters, or form data, I believe the most common way is in the Authorization header.

My understanding is that the use RFC 6750 is an optional, but widely used, part of the protocol, so our resource server will use it as well.

In general, we expect to see a header that looks like this 

```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

The resource server should validate the access token, and if it is valid, return the resources to the client.

I'll write two middlewares. One will extract the token from the authorization header in accorance with RFC 6750 and store the token in the context.

The other middleware will validate that the token in valid, which in this case will just check if it's a string saying the access is granted.

```go

// Extracts the token from the Authorization Header
// It expects to see a header that looks like this
//
//	Authorization: Bearer <token>
func BearerExtractor(c *gin.Context) {
	ah := c.GetHeader("Authorization")
	if ah == "" {
		c.JSON(401, gin.H{"error": "Authorization header is required"})
		c.Abort()
		return
	}

	parts := strings.Split(ah, " ")
	if len(parts) != 2 || parts[0] != "Bearer" {
		c.JSON(401, gin.H{"error": "Authorization header must be in the format `Bearer <token>`"})
		c.Abort()
		return
	}
	token := parts[1]
	c.Set(TokenContextKey, token)
	c.Next()
}

// Validates whether the token is valid and is appropriate for the request
func ValidToken(c *gin.Context) {
	token, ok := c.Get(TokenContextKey)
	if !ok {
		c.JSON(401, gin.H{"error": "Token is missing"})
		c.Abort()
		return
	}
	if token != "ACCESS_GRANTED" {
		c.JSON(401, gin.H{"error": "Invalid token"})
		c.Abort()
		return
	}
	c.Next()
}

```


Now that we've got our middleware, the actual resource server serving up our "protected" private resources.

```go
func ResourceHandler(c *gin.Context) {
	c.JSON(200, gin.H{"yourfile.txt": "your private data is here"})
}

func main() {
	r := gin.Default()
	r.GET("/protected", BearerExtractor, ValidToken, ResourceHandler)
	r.Run("0.0.0.0:8890")
}

```


## Update to the client to use resources.

Let's update the client so it uses the access token to download resources from the resource server.

This can be done anywhere, but I am going to do it in the Callback handler.

The oauth2 package has a convenience http client factory that will automatically add the access token to the request.

Add to your callback handler in the client:

```go 
...
...

	tok, err := config.Exchange(c, code)
	if err != nil {
		c.String(500, "Failed to exchange token: %v", err)
		return
	}
	KNOWN_TOKENS = append(KNOWN_TOKENS, tok)

    // NEW CODE: Get the protected resource
    // automatically adds the access token to the request.
	client := config.Client(c, tok)
	resp, err := client.Get("http://localhost:8890/protected")
	if err != nil || resp.StatusCode != 200 {
		c.String(500, "Failed to get protected resource: %v", resp.Status)
		return
	}

	resource, err := io.ReadAll(resp.Body)
	if err != nil {
		c.String(500, "Failed to read resource: %v", err)
		return
	}
	RESOURCES = append(RESOURCES, resource)

...
...

```


# What's next

I think this low security implementation helps to demonstrate the separation of security concerns. We're going through the motions of the oauth flow,
but everything we've added to this implementation does nothing to secure the system. Our tokens do not expire, nor do they correctly identify what they are
protecting or the scope of access. What's more is that we are vulnerable to replay attacks, eavesdropping and other attacks. We have an oauth flow that
has all the really hard security stripped out of it.

In the next part, I'll be swapping out my bogus tokens with proper JWT tokens. Again JWT is not required for oauth, but it's an obvious and widely used choice,
and it has some really good properties that make it a good choice for oauth. I'll also be adding CSRF protection and showing how it can be used to protect
against various attacks.
